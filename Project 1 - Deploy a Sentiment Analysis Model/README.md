# Project 1 - Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This is the first project of Machine Learning Nanodegree offered by Udacity.

Please see the [sagemaker-deployment](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment) repository provided by Udacity, to see different tutorials and mini projects to learn and use Amazon Sagemaker for building, training and deploying ML models. The code template of this project is also available there.

## Goal

Train and deploy a sentiment analysis model on Sagemaker and use lambda and API gateway services provided by AWS to use the deployed model inside a web interface.

## Technology stack and services used:
- Pytorch
- Amazon Sagemaker
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon API Gateway
